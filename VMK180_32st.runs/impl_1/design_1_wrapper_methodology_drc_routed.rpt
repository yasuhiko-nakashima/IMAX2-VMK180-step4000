2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_pl_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-344#1 Warning
Design_needs_USER_RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY_set  
The Design property USER_RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY on your top-level current_design object is unset (or set to -1).  This will result in a pessimistic estimate for your RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY and your design will likely incur an additional jitter resulting in higher clock uncertainty. Please review your design and RAM activity.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#999 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.222 ns between design_1_i/emax6_0/inst/EMAX6_UNIT[10].unit/stage3_inst/fpu2l/ex2_d_frac_r/q_reg[7]/C (clocked by clkout2_primitive) and design_1_i/emax6_0/inst/EMAX6_UNIT[10].unit/stage4_inst/lmm/fpga_bram64/inst/gen_xpm.gen_base.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_b.gen_byte_narrow.for_mem_cols[1].mem_reg_bram_6/DINADIN[14] (clocked by clkout2_primitive). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.225 ns between design_1_i/emax6_0/inst/EMAX6_UNIT[15].unit/stage3_inst/fpu2h/ex2_d_frac_r/q_reg[15]/C (clocked by clkout2_primitive) and design_1_i/emax6_0/inst/EMAX6_UNIT[15].unit/stage4_inst/lmm/fpga_bram64/inst/gen_xpm.gen_base.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_b.gen_byte_narrow.for_mem_cols[1].mem_reg_bram_14/DINADIN[5] (clocked by clkout2_primitive).

CLKC-72#1 Advisory
Substitute PLL for MMCME5 check  
The MMCME5 cell design_1_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MMCME5_inst has a single input clock whose source driver, UNKNOWN, is not optimally located and the MMCM has a configuration which could be accommodated by a PLL.  Consider changing the MMCM to a PLL which could align better with the input clock driver.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-75#1 Advisory
MMCME5 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME5 cell design_1_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MMCME5_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) design_1_i/versal_cips_0/inst/pspmc_0/inst/buffer_pl_clk_0.PL_CLK_0_BUFG and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
